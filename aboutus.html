                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Urehgab was born out of a deep passion for people, purpose, and potential. The idea came from firsthand experiences of seeing incredible talents go unnoticed and companies struggle to find the right fit not because the talent didn't exist, but because the connection between them was broken or inefficient.</p>
                    
                    <p>The name "Urehgab" itself tells a story: "Ureh" means Child of Gift — a reminder that every individual carries a unique gift that deserves to be seen and nurtured. "Gab" means Strength representing divine purpose, strength, and the calling to uplift others.</p>
